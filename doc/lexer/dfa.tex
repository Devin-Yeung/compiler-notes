\section{DFA}

A deterministic finite automata (DFA) is a 5-tuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where

\begin{itemize}
    \item $Q$ is a finite set called states
    \item $\Sigma$ is a finite set called alphabet
    \item $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ is the transition function
    \item $q_0 \in Q$ is the start state (also called the initial state), and 
    \item $F \subseteq Q$ is the set of accept states (final states).
\end{itemize}
